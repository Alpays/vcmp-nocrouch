# vcmp-nocrouch
A VC:MP Plugin to toggle crouching in Squirrel scripting.

# Description
Since it is not possible to disable crouching in Squirrel scripting yet i've decided to make this plugin to toggle crouching. \
Functions such as "RegisterSquirrelFuncs" are made by LU devs i just added 2 new functions to squirrel.

# Functions
SetCrouchEnabled(bool crouch) - Enables crouching if argument is true disables otherwise. \
GetCrouchEnabled() - Returns true if crouching is enabled false otherwise.
